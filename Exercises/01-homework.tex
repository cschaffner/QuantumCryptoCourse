\begin{exercise}[Purity]
Purity of a quantum state is defined as $\Tr\rho^2$. Consider a $d$-dimensional quantum state $\rho\in \mathbb{C}^{d\times d}$.
\begin{subex}
What is the maximal value of purity, what class of states achieve this value.
\end{subex}

\begin{subex}
What is the minimal value of purity, what state achieves this value.
\end{subex}

\begin{subex}
Any qubit density matrix can be represented by the Bloch vector $\vec{r}$, satisfying $|\vec{r}|\leq 1$. For any quantum state $\tau\in \mathbb{C}^{2\times 2}$ we have that $\tau= \frac{1}{2}\left( \mathbbm{1} + \vec{r}\cdot \vec{\sigma} \right)$, where $\vec{\sigma}=(\sigma_x,\sigma_y,\sigma_z)^T$ is the vector of Pauli matrices. How does purity of $\tau$ relate to $\vec{r}$.
\end{subex}

\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}[Minimum-error measurement of qubits]
Alice is given one of the states $\ket{\theta}:=\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\ket{0}+\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\ket{1}$, $\ket{-\theta}=\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\ket{0}-\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\ket{1}$, each with probability $p:=\frac{1}{2}$. Design a measurement $\{ \Pi_{+},\Pi_{-}\}$, where $\Pi_{+},\Pi_{-}\succeq 0$ and $\Pi_{+}+\Pi_{-}= \mathbbm{1}$, such that the probability of error is minimal. The probability of error is defined as $p_e:= p\Tr(\Pi_{-}\proj{\theta})+(1-p)\Tr(\Pi_{+}\proj{-\theta})$.
\end{exercise}




\begin{exercise}[Parity measurements (Exercise 1.5.1)]
Use a projective measurement to measure the parity, in the Hadamard basis, of
the state $\proj{00}$. Compute the probabilities of obtaining measurement outcomes "even" and
"odd", and the resulting post-measurement states. What would the post-measurement states have
been if you had first measured the qubits individually in the Hadamard basis, and then taken the
parity?
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}[Partial trace (Exercise 1.6.1)]
Verify that the state $\rho_A=\sum_x (\mathbbm{1}\otimes \bra{u_x})\rho_{AB}(\mathbbm{1}\otimes \ket{u_x})$ does not depend on the choice of
basis $\{\ket{u_x}\}$. [Hint: first argue that if two density matrices $\rho$, $\sigma$ satisfy $\bra{\phi}\rho\ket{\phi}=\bra{\phi}\sigma\ket{\phi}$ 
for all unit vectors $\ket{\phi}$ then $\rho=\sigma$. Then compute $\bra{\phi}\rho_A\ket{\phi}$, and use the POVM condition
$\sum_x M_x=\mathbbm{1}$ to check that you can get an expression independent of $\{\ket{u_x}\}$. Conclude that $\rho_A$
itself does not depend on $\{\ket{u_x}\}$.]
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}[Robustness of GHZ and W states (Problem 6.1)]
\begin{subex}
 Now we generalize to the N-qubit case. As you might expect, $\left| GHZ_ N \right\rangle =\frac{1}{\sqrt {2}} (\left| 0 \right\rangle ^{\otimes N}+\left| 1 \right\rangle ^{\otimes N})$ .

What is the overlap $\text {Tr}\Big(\left| GHZ_{N-1} \right\rangle\left\langle {GHZ_{N-1}}\right| \text {tr}_ N\left(\left| GHZ_ N \right\rangle \left\langle GHZ_ N \right|\right)\Big)$ in the limit $N \rightarrow \infty$? 
\end{subex}

\begin{subex}
$\left| W_ N \right\rangle= \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{i=1}^N \underset{1\text{ at the $i$-th place}}{\underbrace{\ket{0\cdots 010\cdots 0}}}$ is an equal superposition of all N-bit strings with exactly one 1 and N-1 0's

What is the overlap $\text {Tr}\Big(\left| W_{N-1} \right\rangle \left\langle {W_{N-1}}\right| \text {tr}_ N\left(\left| W_ N \right\rangle \left\langle W_N \right|\right)\Big)$ in the limit $N \rightarrow \infty$? 
\end{subex}
\end{exercise}
